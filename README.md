Python Mini Projects Collection

This repository contains four Python mini-projects demonstrating basic programming concepts, user interaction, and problem-solving skills. Each project is a command-line application and can be run using Python 3.


Task 1: Basic Calculator

Description: 
A calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) using a dictionary-based approach. The user can input two numbers and select an operation. The program also handles division by zero and invalid inputs.

Features:
- Dictionary-based operation selection.  
- Handles division by zero.  
- Continuous calculation until the user chooses to exit.  
- User-friendly prompts and formatted output.

How to Run:
```bash
python task1_calculator.py

Task 2: Number Guessing Game (Program 3)
Description:
A fun number guessing game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The program provides hints to guide the user closer to the correct number.
Features:
Random number generation between 1 and 100.
Hints when the guess is very close or close to the number.
Counts the number of attempts.
Ends when the user guesses the correct number.
How to Run:
Copy code
Bash
python task2_number_guessing.py
Task 3: Temperature Converter (Program 1)
Description:
A simple temperature converter that converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. The user inputs the temperature and its unit, and the program outputs the equivalent temperatures in other units.
Features:
Converts Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.
Handles invalid unit input.
Simple and clear output format.
How to Run:
Copy code
Bash
python task3_temperature_converter.py
Task 4: Simple To-Do List (Program 1)
Description:
A command-line to-do list application allowing users to add, remove, and view tasks. Tasks are stored in a list during runtime.
Features:
Add tasks.
Remove tasks by name.
View all tasks.
Simple menu-driven interface.
How to Run:
Copy code
Bash
python task4_todo_list.py
Overview
Through these projects, I learned:
How to implement control structures like loops and conditional statements.
How to handle user input and validate it.
How to use functions, dictionaries, and lists effectively.
The basics of program organization and creating simple command-line applications.
These projects helped me strengthen my Python programming fundamentals and problem-solving skills.
